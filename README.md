This project focuses on predicting house prices based on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total square footage using a linear regression model. Basic data preprocessing was carried out, including handling missing values, scaling features, and removing outliers to ensure the data quality. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of house features, with its performance assessed using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error. The results showed that the selected features are good predictors of house prices, although the model could be improved by incorporating additional features like location and amenities. The project serves as a foundational approach for predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques.
